This project is a Python implementation of the paper “VHNet: A Video Hiding Network with robustness to video coding”, built on PyTorch.
Please train CompressNet and JpegGauss before training the whole VHNet framework with the pre-trained model parameters.
Training CompressNet and JpegGauss requires two datasets to be prepared: the original videos and their corresponding compressed videos generated by video coding. The compressed videos can be generated using FFMpeg, which supports the selection of encoding format and compression rate. Once the pre-trained models are saved in the VHNet project (the path and file name can be configured in config.py), the VHNet can be trained by running train.py.
